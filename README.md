# JOIN CODE
## Still working on it...
### what is Join Code?
Join Code aim to be a collaborative google meet stile IDE where people can code together.
It could be use for lessons, debugging, code reviews, code interviews and whatevere do you want to do with it.

It works thanks to websockets, redis pub sub and a simple fastapi backend.
The frontend need some work, i know but i put the most of my effort for the backend right now.
